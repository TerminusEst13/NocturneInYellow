This is a dummy file so ZDoom can easily detect this as an IWAD.
Do not remove it.

Some info on the lumps here:
Colormap.cmp and Playpal.pal are required, they contain a palette I made myself
with some tools I don't remember. The palettes are pretty damned cool looking.
Sndcurve.lmp is a neat little thing that will make sound rolloff... well,
better. Please don't remove it.
Smallfnt.bmf and Dbigfont.bmf are font files containing, you guessed it,
the small and big fonts. They are from, as far as I remember, an open source
bytemap font collection. Please correct me if this is wrong, I can pretty
easily make my own fonts for this.
